Project Description:

Escape of a particle from an intracellular region: A particle is diffusing according to Brownian
motion in a 2D circular domain of radius r. The particle can only exit the domain from an
opening defined by a segment of a circle of angular width θ. Investigate mean exit time of
the domain as a function of θ.
